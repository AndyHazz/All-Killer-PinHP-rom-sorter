# All Killer, No Filler PinHP rom sorter

Put this script in your PinHP advmame_roms folder, along with a full advance mame (0.106) romset

Run './rom-sorter.sh' and it will organise them into folders, choosing only the best quality games based on work by members of the arcadecontrols.com forum here: 
http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php/topic,149708.0.html

Best games from each genre will be moved into their own subfolders:

- Classics
- Platformers
- Beat 'em ups
- Run and gun
- Puzzle
- Sports
- Shoot 'em ups
- Vs Fighting

Everything else will be put in a hidden '[Leftovers]' folder

Partial romsets will work, but you might not get as many games moved into the genre folders
