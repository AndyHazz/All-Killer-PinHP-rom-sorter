# All-Killer-PinHP-rom-sorter

Put this script in you PinHP advmame_roms folder, along with a full romset

Run './rom-sorter.sh' and it will organise them into folders, based on work by members of the arcadecontrols.com forum here: 
http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php/topic,149708.0.html

Best games from each genre will be moved into their own subfolders
Everything else will be put in a hidden '.Leftovers' folder

Initially it's pretty much 'as-is' from the arcadecontrol forum, so includes games that won't run on AdvMame and/or Raspberry pi - over time I'd like to pdate this script to focus on AdvMame and pi2jamma
